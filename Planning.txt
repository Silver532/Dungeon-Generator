Planning Document for Dungeon Generator


Dungeon Generator File 
#Complete
    Inputs: 
            None

    Process:
            Generate Dungeon Tilemap of Room locations and exits encoded using bitmaps
                Init tilemap of given size
                Fill initial room locations
                Erosion pass on Tilemap to generate more natural shape
                Calculation Pass to connect rooms
                Calculation Pass to trim tilemap to max size used
                Calculation Pass to clear unconnected rooms

    Output: 
            numpy array of uint-8 values of size x * y, where each cell has:
                0 - No Room
                16 - Room Exists
                +
                Bitmap[
                    1-North
                    2-East
                    4-South
                    8-West
                        ]
                Example: A room with an exit in each direction would have a value of 31

Room Generator File
    Inputs:
            Room Value (int)

    Process:
            Generate Room Tilemap that is populated with objects
#Complete       Init Tilemap of given size
#Complete       Use room value to generate shape and theme
#Complete       Build room outline onto tilemap using shape
                Populate room tilemap using theme

    Output:
            numpy array of uint-8 values of size x * x, where each cell has:
                FLOOR = 1
                HOLE = 2
                WATER = 3
                TRAP = 4
                HEALING_STATION = 5
                CHEST = 6
                LOOT_PILE = 7

Room Stitcher File
    Inputs:
            None

    Process:
            Generate Dungeon Map
                Output array of size DM_x * DM_y
            Init tilemap of size (DM_x*Room Size) * (DM_y*Room Size)
            For Each Existing Room in Dungeon Map
                Generate Room Map
                    Output array of size (Room Size x Room Size)
                Build room map onto stitched tilemap at designated location

    Output:
            numpy array of size (DM_x*Room Size) * (DM_y*Room Size)
