Planning Document for Dungeon Generator


Dungeon Generator File
    Inputs: 
            Room Count (Optional) (Rough) (int)

    Process:
            Generate Dungeon Tilemap of Room locations and exits encoded using bitmaps
                Init tilemap of given size
                Seed and fill room locations
                Calculation Pass to connect rooms
                Calculation Pass to clear unconnected rooms
                Calculation Pass to add single room extensions
                Calculation Pass to trim tilemap to max size used

    Output: 
            numpy array of uint-8 values of size x * y, where each cell has:
                0 - No Room
                16 - Room Exists
                +
                Bitmap[
                    1-North
                    2-East
                    4-South
                    8-West
                        ]
                Example: A room with an exit in each direction would have a value of 31

Room Generator File
    Inputs:
            Room Value (int)
            Room Shape (string or ENUM)

    Process:
            Generate Room Tilemap that is populated with objects
                Init Tilemap of given size
                Use room value to generate shape and theme
                Build room outline onto tilemap using shape
                Populate room tilemap using theme

    Output:
            numpy array of uint-8 values of size x * x, where each cell has:
                0-Wall
                1-Floor
                2-Loot Pile
                3-Chest
                4-Healing Station
                5-Trap

Room Stitcher File
    Inputs:
            Room Count (Optional) (Rough) (int)

    Process:
            Generate Dungeon Map
                Output array of size DM_x * DM_y
            Init tilemap of size (DM_x*25) * (DM_y*25)
            For Each Existing Room in Dungeon Map
                Generate Room Map
                    Output array of size 25 * 25
                Build room map onto stitched tilemap at designated location

    Output:
            numpy array of size (DM_x*25) * (DM_y*25)
