This is my 4th iteration of this project, and I am pleased to say that it is my best one yet,
even in it's unfinished state.  Iteration 1 can be found on my "Personal Projects" repo, and
is entirely different from what you can see here.  Iterations 2 and 3 will not be put on GitHub,
as I no longer have the source code, and do not wish to recreate them.

What each iteration improved on:
Iteration 1: Started this project.  i1 is an unfinished text based dungeon crawler.
             There were planned systems for save/load, combat, and looting.  Game
             was controlled through terminal commands (eg. go north), and was not
             optimized particularly well.

Iteration 2: Complete rewrite of the code, i2 gave the game graphics for both the
             dungeon and the room maps.  Room generation had a complete overhaul,
             with procedurally generating layouts.  Similarly to i1, this game was
             incomplete, with planned systems for player control, combat, and the
             stitched tilemap system.

Iteration 3: Partial rewrite of i2, with dungeon generation having a complete rewrite.
             This iteration was incredibly unoptimized, though I really liked the room
             system.  This was also the first implementation of the stitched tilemap
             and full dungeon view. Enemies were added for this iteration, but I couldnt
             get them to do anything.

Iteration 4: Complete rewrite of the program. Dungeon generation entirely reworked.
             There is a major focus on optimization this iteration, as well as fixing
             the issues from previous iterations.
